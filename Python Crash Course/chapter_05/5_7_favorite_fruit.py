5_7_favorite_fruit.py

Make a list of your favorite fruits, and then write a series of
independent if statements that check for certain fruits in your list.
• Make a list of your three favorite fruits and call it favorite_fruits.
• Write five if statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit
is in your list. If the fruit is in your list, the if block should print a statement,
such as You really like bananas!
