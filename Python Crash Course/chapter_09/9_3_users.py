9_3_users.py

Make a class called User. Create two attributes called first_name
and last_name, and then create several other attributes that are typically stored
in a user profile. Make a method called describe_user() that prints a summary
of the userâ€™s information. Make another method called greet_user() that prints
a personalized greeting to the user.
Create several instances representing different users, and call both methods
for each user.
